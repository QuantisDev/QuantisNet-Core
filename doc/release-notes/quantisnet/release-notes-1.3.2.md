How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then depending on
your operation system:

* for Window run the installer
* for macos run the installer
* for Linux unpack to a separate folder and run from there

**NOTE**: database re-index is required, if downgrade to version below 1.3.1 is desired later!
